# Word2Vec for Amazon Reviews
Three models (RNN, GRU and MLP) with an embedding layer for Amazon Reviews for sentiment analysis classification using PyTorch, NLTK and Scikit. Two distinct embeddings were compared; a pretrained Word2Vec model <code>"word2vec-google-news-300"</code> from Google, and another trained from scratch by me. As a baseline, each embedding is deployed on a myriad of models using Scikit such as Perceptron, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. Then, both embeddings are used in an MLP, RNN, and a GRU model to compare which model and embedding yielded the best result.
